{"name":"Opsu","tagline":"an open-source osu! client","body":"# About\r\nopsu! is an **unofficial** open-source client for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/),\r\na rhythm game based on popular commercial games such as *Ouendan* and\r\n*Elite Beat Agents*.\r\n\r\nopsu! is written in Java using [Slick2D](http://slick.ninjacave.com/) and\r\n[LWJGL](http://lwjgl.org/), wrappers around the OpenGL and OpenAL libraries.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nPrecompiled binaries for opsu! can be found on the\r\n[releases](https://github.com/itdelatrisu/opsu/releases) page, with the latest\r\nbuilds at the top.\r\n\r\n### Java Setup\r\nThe Java Runtime Environment (JRE) must be installed in order to run opsu!.\r\nThe download page is located [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).\r\n\r\n### Beatmaps\r\nopsu! requires beatmaps to run, which are available for download on the\r\n[osu! website](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/beatmaplist) and mirror sites such as\r\n[osu!Mirror](https://osu.yas-online.net/) or [Bloodcat](http://bloodcat.com/osu/).\r\nBeatmaps can also be downloaded directly through opsu! in the downloads menu.\r\n\r\nIf osu! is already installed, this application will attempt to load songs\r\ndirectly from the osu! program folder.  Otherwise, place songs in the generated\r\n`Songs` folder or set the `BeatmapDirectory` value in the generated\r\nconfiguration file to the path of the root song directory.\r\n\r\nNote that beatmaps are typically delivered as OSZ files.  These can be extracted\r\nwith any ZIP tool, and opsu! will automatically extract them into the songs\r\nfolder if placed in the `SongPacks` directory.\r\n\r\n### First Run\r\nThe `Music Offset` value will likely need to be adjusted when playing for the\r\nfirst time, or whenever hit objects are out of sync with the music.  This and\r\nother game options can be accessed by clicking the \"Other Options\" button in\r\nthe song menu.\r\n\r\n## Building\r\nopsu! is distributed as a Maven project.\r\n\r\n* To run the project, execute the Maven goal `compile exec:exec`.\r\n* To create a single executable JAR file, execute the Maven goal\r\n  `install -Djar`.  This will link the LWJGL native libraries using a\r\n  [modified version](https://github.com/itdelatrisu/JarSplicePlus) of\r\n  [JarSplice](http://ninjacave.com/jarsplice), which is included in the\r\n  `tools` directory in both its original and modified forms.  The resulting\r\n  file will be located in `target/opsu-${version}-runnable.jar`.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\nThis software was created by Jeffrey Han \r\n([@itdelatrisu](https://github.com/itdelatrisu/)).  All game concepts and\r\ndesigns are based on work by osu! developer Dean Herbert.
